# DESIGN-AND-FABRICATION-OF-AUTOMATION-MACHINE-CENTRE

This project showcases advanced technologies to improve woodworking processes. It uses a combination of a conveyor belt system, flipping mechanism, CNC milling and laser stations, and a liquid polishing station, all designed in SolidWorks, manufactured with 3D printing, and controlled by Arduino.

Here's how it works:

1. Conveyor Belt**: A continuously moving belt brings wooden workpieces into the system.
2. Flipping Mechanism**: This device accurately positions the workpieces on the main conveyor belt.
3. Main Conveyor Belt**: Controlled by Arduino, it moves the workpieces to various stations.
4. CNC Milling Station**: Here, a gripper holds the workpiece for precise machining.
5. CNC Laser Station**: Another gripper holds the workpiece for laser cutting or engraving.
6. Liquid Polishing Station**: The workpiece is polished to achieve a smooth finish.

By integrating SolidWorks design, 3D printing, and Arduino control, this project demonstrates the power of automation in enhancing manufacturing processes. It optimizes workflow, improves efficiency, and ensures high-quality results in woodworking.
